# React_Query
Hi, I made a React Query sample page in which I learnt about : <br/>
1. Implementing React Query:
    *  creating an API folder with a data.json file, then setting up React Query with a query function to fetch and manipulate data efficiently.
    *  It includes the creation of a post list component.

2. Adding Mutation and UI Elements:
    *  the addition of a mutation function, enabling the posting of new data.
3. UI elements such as input fields and buttons implemented 
 for user interaction with the application.

Here is a screenshot of React App. <br/>
